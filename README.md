Made this a while ago and it sucks but it was fun to learn a new library
written in python and utilizes the Ursina library to generate a 3D plane.
Uses Perlin Noise to generate the "World"


-----Installation-----

Dillinger requires Ursina and OpenSimplex to run.

Install the libraries and run "run.py".
